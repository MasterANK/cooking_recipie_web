                    <h2 id="Food_Name">Dosa</h2>

                    <p id="Desc">Dosa is a popular and versatile South Indian dish that has gained widespread recognition for its unique preparation and 
                        delightful taste. This thin, crispy pancake is made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram) and is a staple in 
                        South Indian cuisine. The batter undergoes a fermentation process, contributing to the characteristic tangy flavor and the 
                        development of a light and airy texture in the dosa. <br><br>

                        The preparation of dosa involves spreading the batter thinly on a hot griddle or skillet, creating a large, circular pancake 
                        that is cooked until golden brown and crispy. This cooking technique results in a delightful interplay of textures, with the 
                        edges offering a satisfying crunch while the center remains soft and slightly chewy. <br><br>
                        
                        Dosa is often served with a variety of accompaniments that further enhance its appeal. The most common pairing is with coconut 
                        chutney and sambar, a flavorful and spiced lentil-based soup. The combination of dosa, coconut chutney, and sambar creates a 
                        harmonious balance of flavors, from the savory and tangy notes of the dosa to the cooling and slightly sweet nuances of the 
                        coconut chutney and the hearty warmth of the sambar. <br><br>
                        
                        Beyond its traditional form, dosa has evolved to include numerous variations and fillings, making it a versatile and creative 
                        dish. Stuffed dosas, known as masala dosa, often feature a spiced potato filling, adding complexity to the overall flavor profile. 
                        These variations, combined with the dosa's adaptability to different regional preferences, have contributed to its popularity not 
                        only in South India but also worldwide, making it a beloved and iconic dish in the realm of global cuisine.
