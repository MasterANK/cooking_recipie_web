                        Pancakes are a beloved breakfast food enjoyed in various forms across cultures. Typically, <strong>They're flat, round,</strong> 
                        and cooked on a griddle or skillet. The batter is made from a mixture of flour, eggs, milk (or buttermilk), 
                        a leavening agent (like baking powder), and a hint of sweetness (sugar or sometimes flavored with vanilla). 
                        This batter is poured onto a hot cooking surface and cooked until golden brown on both sides.<br><br>

                        Their texture can vary from fluffy and light to slightly denser, depending on the recipe and ingredients used. 
                        <strong>They're often served stacked on a plate, with each layer separated by a drizzle of syrup (such as maple syrup) 
                        or toppings like butter, fruit, chocolate chips, whipped cream, or nuts.</strong><br><br>

                        Pancakes are versatile and adaptable, allowing for various modifications and additions to suit different 
                        tastesâ€”whether you prefer them as a sweet morning treat or a savory option by adding ingredients like cheese, 
                        herbs, or vegetables. They're a comforting, easy-to-make dish that's loved by many for its simplicity and 
                        deliciousness!<br><br>
