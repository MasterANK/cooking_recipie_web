                    <p id="Desc">
                        Poha, also known as flattened rice or beaten rice, is a popular dish in India, 
                        especially in regions like Maharashtra and parts of Central India. It's made 
                        from rice that has been parboiled, flattened, and then dried to produce light, 
                        flaky, and easily digestible flakes.<br><br>

                        To prepare poha, the flattened rice is typically rinsed briefly to rehydrate 
                        and soften it. It's then often saut√©ed with various ingredients such as onions, 
                        mustard seeds, curry leaves, turmeric, peanuts, green chilies, and sometimes potatoes 
                        or peas, depending on the recipe and regional variations.<br><br>

                        The dish can be seasoned with spices to add flavor and depth, and it's usually served 
                        as a breakfast or snack item. Poha is known for its lightness, quick preparation, and 
                        versatility. It can be enjoyed as a standalone dish or accompanied by sides such as yogurt, 
                        chutney, or a cup of tea.<br><br>

                        Poha comes in different thicknesses, with thicker varieties requiring a bit more soaking 
                        before cooking, while thinner ones might need just a quick rinse. It's a popular vegetarian 
                        and gluten-free option, making it a favorite among many for its simplicity and delicious taste.<br><br>
